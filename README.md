This is a simple React application to display a user details in a card.
I have consumed https://randomuser.me/api/ API , inorder to get user details dynamically.
I have used Bootstrap in order to get Responsive UI elements.
I have used fontawesome icons, hovering on which the card content will change.
App runs on localhost:3000
